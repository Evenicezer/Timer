# Timer
Timer
### Here's how this script works:

It uses the tkinter library to create a simple GUI.
The simpledialog.askinteger function prompts the user to enter the number of minutes.
The start_countdown function starts the countdown.
The update_timer function updates the timer every second until it reaches zero.
The timer is displayed in a label widget.
To run this script, make sure you have Python installed on your laptop. Save the script to a file, for example, countdown_timer.py, and run it using your Python interpreter by executing python countdown_timer.py from your command line or terminal.

### In this script:

The update_timer function now calculates the absolute value of countdown_time when formatting the time string, ensuring that minutes and seconds are displayed correctly even for negative values.
The label.config(fg='red') line changes the text color to red when the countdown_time is below zero.
The countdown continues to decrement and update the display every second, even after reaching zero.
